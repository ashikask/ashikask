Over the past 7 years working as an iOS Mobile Application developer at various organizations on customer-facing products, I have gained a first-hand understanding of user pain points and a mindset to focus on customer success while building products. While at SAP as a new joiner, I worked with and led a geographically distributed team to deliver critical workloads well within schedule.
As part of my master's in information science program, I have completed Application Development Engineering which deals with systematically combining UX techniques, business processes, and complex data models to assemble applications. The course also covers how to employ the object-oriented paradigm, visual user experience, and system design principles to put together complicated, powerful, real-world applications. In addition, I have also taken up Web Design and User Experience Engineering which involves the fundamental concepts, techniques, and tools associated with the practice of user-experience design in Web interfaces. Current semester I have taken up Program Structure & Algorithms and Data Management and Database Design to further strengthen my fundamentals in these areas.
